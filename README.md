# TelemarketingPredictiveModel
Machine Learning Project for a bank telemarketing campaign

# Description:
This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on analyzing a bank telemarketing campaign dataset. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms for classification, clustering, and association rule mining to gain insights into customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.


# Key features
  1) Classification: Employed machine learning algorithms to classify whether customers will buy a bank term deposit based on demographic and behavioral attributes.
  2) Clustering: Utilized clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on similarities in their characteristics and behaviors, enabling targeted marketing approaches.
  3) Association Rules: Extracted association rules to uncover patterns and relationships between different customer actions and attributes, providing valuable insights for campaign optimization and customer targeting.
